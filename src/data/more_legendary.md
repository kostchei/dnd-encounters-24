>***Contamination.*** The sibriex emits an aura of corruption 30 feet in every direction. Vegetation withers in the aura, and the ground in the aura is difficult terrain for other creatures. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this sibriex's Contamination for 24 hours.  
>
>***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the sibriex fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  
>
>***Magic Resistance.*** The sibriex has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

>
>At will: *command*, *dispel magic*, *hold monster*  
>1/day: *feeblemind*  
>
>
>***Squirt Bile.*** The sibriex targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 31 (9d6) acid damage.  
>
>***Warp Creature.*** The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to gain another level of exhaustion. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms into a living **manes** under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a *wish* spell.  
>

> ##### Variant: Flesh Warping
>
>Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into a manes, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body. A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.

The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a failed save, it has the petrified condition, and on a successful save, the effect ends on it. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the *Greater Restoration* spell or other magic.

The shard inhabits the object until it uses an action to leave; until it is turned; until it is reduced to 0 hit points; or until an effect that ends possession, such as a *dispel evil and good* spell, is used on it. When it leaves the object, it reappears in the nearest unoccupied space.  
>While inhabited, the object becomes a magic item if it wasn't already, and a Tiny cracked gemstone matching the kind of gem dragon the shard was in life appears somewhere on the object. The shard can cause the object to fly using the shard's own flying speed, use its senses, speak verbally or telepathically, cast spells, and use its legendary actions.
